## Getting Started

The Up API is currently in beta 🔧. Many features you would expect are notably
absent but will be added over time. In this early phase access is limited to
personal use only.

If you don’t already have an Up bank account, you can head over to
https://up.com.au to download the app and create a free account.
[Terms and conditions](https://up.com.au/terms) apply.

Once you have an Up account, you can get your Personal Access Token at
https://api.up.com.au.

Head on over and read the API documentation at https://developer.up.com.au once
you have your access token ❤.
